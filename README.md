# Drowsiness Detection System
This computer vision model aims at building a system able to detect and distinguish between when a human is awake and when is drawsy.

When a human is detected by the camera, the system will display the category, which is either Awake or Drawsy, with the relative percentage of confidence.

The training process has been carried out by using live snapshots images of the person shown here (me) applying the corresponding labels to train the model in recognizing the 2 different situations.
